      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The New Kawaii Draft League is a fun, casual league where players earn
          points for match wins during Friday night drafts.
        </li>
        <li>
          League seasons are structured around each set release.
        </li>
        <li>
          Each season commences with the first Friday night draft following the
          prerelease weekend and concludes on the Friday preceding the prerelease
          of the subsequent set.
        </li>
        <li>
          The season culminates in a draft featuring the top eight players present
          on the final Friday. The size of the final table may be adjusted according
          to total attendance to avoid disrupting regular draft activities.
          <br />
          <em class="indented-example">
            For example, if thirteen players are present, the tables may be divided
            into groups of seven and six players.
          </em>
        </li>
        <li>
          The winner of the final draft is designated as the season champion.
        </li>
        <li>
          Current season standings can be viewed on the <a href="./index.html" class="nav-inline-link">Leaderboard</a> page.
        </li>

    <!-- Points Card -->
    <div class="card">
      <h2>Points</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Players will be awarded <strong>3 points</strong> per match win and
          <strong>1 point</strong> per match draw.
        </li>
        <li>
          Players will be ranked based on total points. The first tiebreaker will
          be wins, followed by matches played.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Ratings Card -->
    <div class="card">
      <h2>Ratings</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Any participant in a league event will be assigned an Elo rating, a predictive rating system used to
          represent a player’s relative skill level. Lifetime Elo ratings are published on the <a href="./lifetime-ratings.html" class="nav-inline-link">Lifetime Ratings</a> page.
        </li>
        <li>
          All players begin with a base Elo rating of 1600. When competing against opponents with similar Elo
          ratings, a player will typically gain 8 Elo points for a win and lose 8 Elo points for a loss.
        </li>
        <li>
          For higher Rules Enforcement Level (REL) competitive events, such as Regional Championship Qualifiers
          (RCQs), Elo point adjustments will be doubled relative to standard draft events.
        </li>
        <li>
          Each event page includes a section highlighting notable upsets, defined as matches in which the
          winning player gains 10 or more Elo points.
        </li>
